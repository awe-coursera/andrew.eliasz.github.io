This is a great way to insert a graphic or a pull-quote.
Note, however, that the position of a floated element is flush against the left side or flush against the right side of the parent containing block-level element or any preceding floated element, with only the CSS margin setting to control its horizontal position. Vertical positioning of floated elements is done by the location of their HTML code in the document in relation to the adjacent elements.
